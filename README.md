# End-to-End MLOps Pipeline for Network Intrusion Detection

A production‑grade, end‑to‑end MLOps pipeline for detecting network intrusions using machine learning. This project covers the full lifecycle—from data ingestion and validation to model training, evaluation, deployment, and CI/CD—built with modular, scalable components.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Modern networks generate massive volumes of traffic, making manual threat detection impractical. This project implements a machine‑learning–driven Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that can automatically identify malicious activity and deploy models reliably using MLOps best practices.

## 🧠 Solution Overview

The pipeline is designed to be reproducible, extensible, and deployment‑ready:
- Ingest and validate network traffic data
- Preprocess and engineer features
- Train and evaluate ML models
- Version and manage artifacts
- Serve predictions via an API
- Automate checks with CI/CD
